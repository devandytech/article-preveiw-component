## My process

Everything(all element) are treated as box containers for easy styling and alignment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript DOM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was going to use the JavaScript toggle to manipulate elements on when the share is been clicked initially, but encounter some errors and i decided to use and adapte another approach by using the javascript classlist(add and remove) and conditional statement(if...else) for manipulation.

### Continued development

I thought at the beginning that this project was going to be a walk through for me tho, i really would love to see if there was other techniques or processes used in this project by other participants.

## Acknowledgments

I did figure everything out myself eventually though, but i have decided to experiment with some library and resources used. For example, for DOM media query which was almost making havoc and confusion for me i found a JavaScript library.
